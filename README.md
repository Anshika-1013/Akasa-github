# Aviation Flight Delay Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight delays using a dataset of flights, including departure and arrival times, flight duration, and delay minutes. The objective is to identify trends in delays, discover patterns associated with airlines and departure times, and provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled inconsistent date and time formats for departure and arrival.
  - Managed missing values in the `DelayMinutes` column by filling them with the mean delay per flight route.
  - Removed duplicate flight entries.
  - Corrected AM/PM errors for inconsistent times.

- **Data Normalization**:
  - Converted date columns (`DepartureDate`, `ArrivalDate`) to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
  - Converted time columns (`DepartureTime`, `ArrivalTime`) to 24-hour format.
  - Calculated flight durations in minutes.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Distribution of flight delays.
  - Average delay by airline.
  - Impact of departure times on delays.
  - Identification of relationships between flight delays and departure times.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Histogram of flight delays.
  - Boxplot and violin plots showing delay distributions per airline.
  - Line plot illustrating the relationship between delay minutes and departure hours.

## Insights

- **Delay Patterns**: 
  - Most delays are under 30 minutes, with some significant outliers.
  - Flights departing between 2 PM and 6 PM tend to experience the longest delays.
  - Airlines like American Airlines and Delta show higher average delays.

- **Recommendations for Airlines**:
  - Consider scheduling optimizations to reduce delays during peak hours.
  - Focus on minimizing delays through improved ground handling and operational processes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aviation-flight-delay-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the data analysis:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

## Usage

- To analyze the dataset, ensure the `aviation_data.csv` file is placed in the root directory.
- Visualizations and insights will be generated and can be viewed in the terminal or saved as image files.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `FlightNumber`: Unique identifier for each flight.
- `DepartureDate`: Date of departure.
- `DepartureTime`: Time of departure in 24-hour format.
- `ArrivalDate`: Date of arrival.
- `ArrivalTime`: Time of arrival in 24-hour format.
- `Airline`: The airline operating the flight.
- `DelayMinutes`: The delay duration in minutes.
- `FlightDurationMinutes`: Calculated duration of the flight in minutes.
